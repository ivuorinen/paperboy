# PaperBoy

CLI tool to generate a weekly grouped list of articles from defined RSS feeds.

## Usage

Create `template.md` and `config.yaml` in the same directory as the binary.

There are examples of both of these files in the `examples` directory.

## Configuration (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
feeds:
  - https://xkcd.com/atom.xml
  - https://www.foxtrot.com/feed/
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
  - https://feeds.feedburner.com/codinghorror
  - https://internetofshit.net/rss/
  - https://techcrunch.com/feed/
template: template.md
output: output.md
```

## Template (`template.md`)

```markdown
# Paperboy weekly newsletter

---

---

Generated by [paperboy](https://github.com/ivuorinen/paperboy)
```

The contents are rendered between the two `---` lines.

Then run the binary `paperboy` and the output will be written to the file specified in the `config.yaml` file.

ProTip: Use a cron job to run this weekly and send the output to your email.
